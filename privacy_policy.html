        <h1><strong>Privacy Policy for the "Technological Usage Patterns Among Students" Study</strong></h1>
        <h2><strong>1. Acceptance of Terms</strong></h2>
        <p>This Privacy Policy is an integral part of your participation in the "Technological Usage Patterns Among
            Students" study. By accessing and using our survey platform, you signify your explicit understanding and
            acceptance of the terms outlined here. This policy applies to all data collected during your participation
            in the study. If at any time you find yourself in disagreement with any part of this policy, we respectfully
            request that you abstain from participating in the study. Your participation is entirely voluntary and is
            subject to the terms presented herein.</p>
        <h2><strong>2. Information Collection</strong></h2>
        <p>We engage in a comprehensive data collection process to enhance the validity and accuracy of our research
            findings. This process includes the collection of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Detailed responses to survey questions, which may include personal opinions, experiences, and
                demographic information.</li>
            <li>Specific device information, such as the type of device (mobile, tablet, desktop), operating system,
                browser type, and other related technical details to understand the technology usage patterns.</li>
            <li>Interaction metrics with our survey and externally hosted pages, including the time spent, scrolling
                behavior, and any interactions with the content, to analyze engagement levels.</li>
            <li>Timestamps and frequency of interactions with our survey platform to monitor participation rates and
                study behavioral patterns over time.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>3. Use of Information</strong></h2>
        <p>The collected information serves multiple research purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>To gain a comprehensive understanding of the technological habits and preferences among university
                students.</li>
            <li>To perform in-depth analyses of how different demographic groups interact with technology.</li>
            <li>To correlate technology usage patterns with academic and personal outcomes.</li>
            <li>The information will help in understanding the general attitudes towards privacy policies and data
                protection awareness among the student population.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>4. Data Storage and Security</strong></h2>
        <p>We prioritize the security and confidentiality of your data. Here are our rigorous measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All data is securely stored on encrypted servers managed by Utrecht University and <a
                    href="https://mbwebsolutions.nl/">MB Web Solutions</a>.</li>
            <li>Regular audits and updates are conducted to keep our security measures robust and up-to-date.</li>
            <li>Access to the data is strictly limited to authorized research personnel and is governed by strict
                confidentiality agreements.</li>
            <li>In the event of a data breach, affected participants will be notified promptly through a message on the
                Qualtrics study, and all necessary steps will be taken to minimize any potential impact.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>5. Data Retention</strong></h2>
        <p>The retention of collected data is managed as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Data is retained for a period of three years post-study completion to allow for thorough analysis and
                publication of research findings.</li>
            <li>After this period, all personal data will be either securely destroyed or anonymized, ensuring that
                individual participants cannot be identified from the retained information.</li>
            <li>The decision to anonymize or destroy the data is contingent on its relevance to ongoing or future
                research, with a strong preference for anonymization to facilitate longitudinal studies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>6. IP Address and Session Tracking</strong></h2>
        <p>While we do not actively collect IP addresses for profiling purposes, our systems automatically record
            session information as part of maintaining the integrity of the survey and its responses. This includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Date and time of access to the survey.</li>
            <li>Duration of the session.</li>
            <li>Any re-access patterns that might indicate repeated participation or technical issues.</li>
            <li>This information is crucial in preventing fraudulent entries and ensuring the reliability of our survey
                results.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>7. Participant Consent</strong></h2>
        <p>Your participation in the survey is contingent upon your consent, which is considered granted upon your
            survey engagement. This consent includes agreement to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The collection and analysis of your survey responses and interaction data.</li>
            <li>The use of this data in accordance with this privacy policy.</li>
            <li>We assure you that your participation is voluntary, and you may withdraw your consent at any time
                without any adverse consequences.</li>
            <li>You understand that the real goal of this study is to track whether you read this privacy policy, so
                please refrain from sharing this with others as this might compromise study validity.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>8. Your Rights</strong></h2>
        <p>As a participant, you are entitled to certain rights regarding your personal data:</p>

        <h2><strong>9. Changes to the Privacy Policy</strong></h2>
